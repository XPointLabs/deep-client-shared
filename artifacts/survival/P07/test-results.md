- Focused TRX SHA-256: `ba73b56fc7c5a125fe963c811d7b61416007ed43da83e7a6c285f23c47715984`.
- Schema/flags TRX SHA-256: `7796086883d001cda9ef2dbd2c11b5aa78931246fdc38560423b2f527dcd94d2`.

The commands above were run from exact source commit
`5cd1d8dfd8e1f7dd33793e937c840ba315daac27`. The dependency gate also
verified the P04 source/review/final ancestry and all three exact global-cache
package archives without depending on sibling repository HEAD or cleanliness.

TRX files were not committed because they contain machine-local paths. No
external, device, Docker, or network E2E lane was run or claimed.

Exact commands and exit codes:

| Command | Exit |
| --- | ---: |
| `& .\eng\scripts\Invoke-P07DependencyGate.ps1` (before restore) | 0 |
| `dotnet restore .\Deep.Client.Shared.slnx --locked-mode` | 0 |
| `& .\eng\scripts\Invoke-P07DependencyGate.ps1` (after restore) | 0 |
| `dotnet test .\tests\Deep.Client.Shared.Tests\Deep.Client.Shared.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --no-restore --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MembershipTrust" --logger "trx;LogFileName=p07-corrective5-focused.trx" --results-directory .\artifacts\survival\P07\trx` | 0 |

The Windows checkout initially materialized one pre-existing push fixture with
CRLF because global `core.autocrlf=true`. Its worktree SHA-256 was
`76bda247901e6f0c651db790b6ac8335e0735ec1be666dad9cb3b2b1278a6013`.
Mr. X authorized exact working-tree-only LF normalization from the unchanged
Git blob; the resulting SHA-256 is
`4bca6bffffa751d124a322a51af878476522faa9ded8a56bd2c89f93ac1e576a`.
The blob remained `76005cbb4fdbcdd8cd0b9eef8482af2386067741` and the fixture has no Git diff.
